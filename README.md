A simple solution to the Frontend Mentor **Meet landing page** challenge.

## Built With
- Vite
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally or build it for production.

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

After running this command, Vite will provide a local URL where you can view the project in your browser.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a dist folder containing the optimized, production-ready files. You can deploy the contents of this folder to any static hosting service (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
